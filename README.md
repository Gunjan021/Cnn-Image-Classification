# Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks. The notebook is designed for educational purposes and can be adapted for real-world datasets.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Includes steps to load and preprocess image datasets.
- **Model Architecture**: Implements a CNN model using popular deep learning frameworks.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model and evaluates its performance on test data.
- **Visualization**: Includes visualizations of training metrics and sample predictions.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework used in the code)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` (if provided)

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "CNN for Image Classification.ipynb"
   ```

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load data, build the model, and train it.

## Dataset

- The notebook is designed to work with standard image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST) or custom datasets.
- Ensure your dataset is organized into training, validation, and testing folders if you use a custom dataset.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture includes:

- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction.
- **Pooling Layers**: For dimensionality reduction.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU and Softmax.

Modify the architecture in the notebook to suit your specific requirements.

## Training

- The notebook trains the model using a specified number of epochs and batch size.
- Includes real-time visualization of training and validation accuracy/loss.

## Evaluation

- Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set.
- Visualize sample predictions with true and predicted labels.

## Results

- Training and validation accuracy/loss plots.
- Example predictions to showcase model performance.

## Customization

You can adapt the code for:

- Different datasets.
- Advanced architectures like ResNet or VGG.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
